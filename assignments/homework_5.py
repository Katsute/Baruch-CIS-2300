'''
Given a variable n that contains a positive integer value, use two additional variables
k and total to write a for loop to compute the sum of the cubes of the first n counting numbers,
and store this value in total. Thus your code should put 1*1*1 + 2*2*2 + 3*3*3 + ... + n*n*n into total.
Use no other variables other than n, k, and total.

Compute the average of the numbers from 1 to n (where n is a positive integer value) 
and assign it to the variable avg.
