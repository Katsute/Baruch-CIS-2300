"""
Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of hours they worked for in a given week.
Number of hours entered should be in the range of 0 to 60.
Also ask user to enter their pay rate. It should be a positive value above minimum wage (Assume minimum wage of $15).
Your program should ask user to re-enter the values for hours and wages until valid inputs are given. Based on the hours entered calculate their wages as follows:
40 hours or less: regular pay
between 40 and 50: regular pay for first 40 + 1.5*regular pay for extra hours above 40
between 50 and 60: regular pay for first 40 + 1.5*regular pay for next 10 hours + 2*regular pay for extra hours above 50
